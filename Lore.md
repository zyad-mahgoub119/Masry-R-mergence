# Masry-R-mergence
A "Europa Universalis V" mod, about Egyptian ALT-History

Point of Divergence (1009–1096 AD)
In real history, in 1009 AD, during the reign of the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, unlike his predecessors, Al-Hakim began actively persecuting Christians. He destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.
In this alternate timeline, however, the point of divergence occurs when Al-Hakim kills the Coptic Pope Zacharias after the latter protested and demanded the same fairness and tolerance that Al-Hakim’s father and grandfather had previously shown toward the Copts. Al-Hakim’s response was brutal—he had the Pope burned at the stake in the middle of Alexandria in 1009.
This event became the breaking point. The Copts rose up in waves of rebellion and raids across Egypt, and the movement rapidly grew in strength. The tone in the monasteries changed, portraying Al-Hakim as if he were Diocletian reborn. The realm descended into chaos, and fires spread everywhere. The King of Makuria declared war on the Fatimid Caliphate. Though the Fatimids eventually won by a miracle, their mercenaries and troops soon turned on one another.
By 1019, the Turkic soldiers in Al-Hakim’s army rebelled, attacking the newly formed Druze movement, which had proclaimed Al-Hakim’s divinity. Meanwhile, the pope-less Coptic Church rallied the masses and began guerrilla wars against the increasingly unstable Fatimid state.
Al-Hakim disappeared on the night of February 13, 1021, during a solitary ride to the Mokattam Hills outside Cairo. A search party later found his donkey and blood-stained garments.
His sister, Sitt al-Mulk, sought to stabilize Egypt. She offered the Church of Alexandria greater freedoms by formally issuing “Al-Kanoun Al-Masry” (similar to the Magna Carta). This document codified the principles of:
A jizya system based on economic status and Nile flood percentage
Protection of worship
Protection of land rights and ownership
Fair trials for all free men
In return, the Copts agreed to end their rebellion and swear fealty to her.
Under this new order, Alexandria’s autonomy grew—not in an independent sense, but as a powerful civic and intellectual center within the Caliphate. Over time, the Copts re-established themselves as the bureaucratic backbone of the empire, rivaling the administrative sophistication of China and the Eastern Roman Empire.
The Catechetical School of Alexandria, alongside the rebuilt Library of Alexandria, flourished once again, drawing inspiration from Al-Azhar University in Cairo. It became a center of Coptic and scientific learning. Northern Egypt evolved into a more civic and intellectual region, incorporating the innovations of both the Coptic and Islamic Golden Ages from Alexandria and Cairo.
The Fatimid Caliphate, though shaken, emerged more centralized, efficient, and stable, successfully reasserting control over the Levant. With the aid of the Coptic bureaucratic elite, its administration reached new heights of organization and sophistication.
The eventual decline came only with the Seljuk invasion of the Levant in 1077. The Seljuks captured Damascus after a war of six years, which ended with the arrival of the First Crusade—marking the beginning of a new and turbulent era. The Crusaders destroyed the Seljuks in the Levant. The Fatimids believed they had come to aid their cause against the Seljuks, but this was not the case. The Crusaders turned against the Fatimids, pushing them back to Sinai.

The Crusades (1096–1118 AD)
In the spring of 1118, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem stood tantalizingly close to launching a full-scale invasion of Egypt—a move that could have dramatically reshaped the political landscape of the medieval Middle East. At the head of his Crusader army, Baldwin had successfully breached the formidable Egyptian border fortress of Farama and advanced deep into the eastern Nile Delta. Yet his ambitious campaign was abruptly halted when he fell gravely ill. His death soon after left his army in disarray.
In the aftermath, the Sultanate descended into chaos. The Fatimid Caliphate—already weakened—collapsed entirely; the Caliph was killed by his cousin. Tunis shifted its allegiance to the Sunni world, and a deep power vacuum engulfed Egypt. Amid the turmoil, the Caliphate searched for an heir to the state, and the most legitimate claimant was none other than the Pope.
His birth name was Marwan of the Fatimid Dynasty. He dismantled the Sultanate, adopting the title Pope Krystafer I. The Caliphate’s line now passed to whoever held the papacy of Egypt. Declaring that the Sultanate had failed to protect its people, Krystafer ended the system in its current form, proclaiming:
“My family has failed to protect our beloved home. What right do we have to cling to a failing system?”
With this act, he ended the main branch of the Fatimids, though the cadet branch, known as Al-Azhar, survived. The Pope punished those who had killed the Caliph but forgave the rest of the family, establishing Egypt as the theocratic seat of Saint Mark and the Caliphate.
Under his leadership, the Church assumed control of mainland Egypt, establishing a new Christian-led administration rooted in the traditions of the old Alexandrian bureaucracy. Seeking stability, Krystafer declared war against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, retaking the Sinai Peninsula—thus ending centuries of direct Fatimid rule and ushering in a new Coptic era in Egypt’s history. The war concluded with Egypt and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem emerging as hegemons in the region. He stabilized relations with both the Crusader state and the papacy in Rome.

The Reemergence (1118–1335 AD)
Egypt became a breeding ground for mercantile families as the merchant class grew and competed for influence, each seeking to place their sons on the papal seat. The Karimi class expanded trade with China via land routes, but as the Mongols began their westward expansion, Egypt shifted to maritime trade, building fleets and arsenals that reached far beyond the Red Sea.
In 1258, the Mongols, led by Hulagu Khan, captured Baghdad and Damascus, ending Seljuk rule, bringing the heart of the Islamic world to its knees, and destroying the Kingdom of Jerusalem after taking the city. Soon after, their forces advanced to the fortress of Farama, standing at Egypt’s eastern gates. There, Pope Krystafer II personally took up the sword, meeting the Mongols in battle. Against all odds, he defeated them, earning Egypt the title “The Last Shield of Christendom.”
Over his three decades of rule, Pope Krystafer II dedicated himself to learning and translation, sponsoring more intellectual work than any of his predecessors. He died in 1266, leaving behind an intellectually flourishing, educated, and self-confident Egypt.
After him came Pope Anastasyos, from the now merchant-Karimi Al-Azhar cadet branch of the Fatimids. His reign became infamous for corruption—he imposed taxes that violated Al-Kanoun Al-Masry, adopting a new charter that granted the Pope absolute power, claiming divine authority rather than Fatimid law.
In 1271, an archbishop named Sæwērys Maersh rose to prominence. Born into the influential Maersh family—a line of merchant-Karimis—he received one of the finest educations of his age. Fluent in Arabic, Coptic, Greek, and French, and trained in both theology and philosophy, he embodied the perfect fusion of trade, intellect, and faith.

The Reemergence (continued)
Fascinated by ancient history and the lost wisdom of Egypt, Sæwērys devoted himself to the study of old manuscripts, Alexandrian Neoplatonism, and Arabic Golden Age philosophy. While examining artifacts seized by the Church at Rashid (Rosetta), he encountered an unusual stone covered in Greek text alongside ancient temple inscriptions. Realizing its significance, he began a lifelong quest to decipher it.
For the next twenty years (from 1255 to 1271), Sæwērys acquired numerous old papyri across Egypt, collecting inscriptions and comparing them. He came to suspect that the texts were written in a trilingual format—Greek, Coptic, and the ancient Egyptian script from the eras of Apion, Manetho, and Chameron—dealing with the history and language of Egypt. After decades of painstaking effort, he finally cracked the code of the ancient Egyptian language, unlocking voices that had been silent for millennia.
As he and his students continued translating newly discovered temple texts, Sæwērys’s thought took on a mystical, philosophical tone. He began to reinterpret Christian theology through the lens of ancient Egyptian spirituality, teaching that divine truth had always resided in Egypt. Disillusioned with biblical portrayals of Egypt as a land of tyranny, he instead proclaimed it the holiest of holies.
He taught that Amun—the Hidden One—was the essence of all existence, the Father beyond being, and that all things emanate from Him. In his words:
“God is Amun, the Hidden One beyond all—the One and Only Essence itself.”
This doctrine sought to harmonize Christianity with ancient Egyptian metaphysics. Sæwērys claimed that Amun was the true Father of the Savior Jesus, and that Mary’s flight into Egypt symbolized a return to the divine source:
“The Son of God died and rose after three days—but the Sun of God rises every day in Egypt.”
In 1290, he began preaching about divine order, teaching that even evil was, in itself, part of the Hidden Essence. This symbolized his belief that even Satan (Samael) was a reflection of the divine essence—an inseparable part of God’s totality. This radical teaching shook the foundations of the Church. The hierarchy condemned his doctrines as heresy, and over the course of the year, eight councils were convened to debate and denounce his ideas.
Arsæn Maersh tried to mediate and prevent the conflict, but he was betrayed in 1300. He was executed by order of the Pope. Yet peace never came. Their victory marked not an end, but the beginning of a long and bitter war—a war not only for power but for the soul and future of Egypt.


The Great Schism (1335 AD)
The priest’s teachings found fertile ground among the people of the Nile Delta. Though the Church eventually executed him for heresy in 1297—after his declaration in Menoufia, “The Son of God died and rose after three days, but the Sun of God rises every day in Egypt”—it was already too late.
His students continued his work, spreading his ideas. Even segments of Egypt’s remaining Muslim population began to embrace this new syncretic faith, for Sæwērys Maersh had canonized Muhammad as a prophet of Amun, the Hidden One. Out of this fusion of Coptic mysticism and Islamic reverence emerged a powerful new movement, with a distinct theology and culture that spread rapidly throughout Lower Egypt.
The ruling Coptic theocracy, alarmed by the popularity of these teachings, viewed them as a direct threat to both doctrine and order. In response, it convened the Council of 1300—the Ninth Council—which formally condemned the movement as heresy and declared war upon it. This act also marked the official dissolution of Al-Kanoun Al-Masry, the foundational charter of Egypt’s semi-autonomous order established centuries earlier under Sitt al-Mulk.
Arsæn’s  grandson, Krystafer Maersh, managed to escape in 1306 now six-year-old with the help and the money of the Maersh family connections in and out of egypt, taking asylum in Venice. There, the maersh families business continued allowing Krystafer to learn and grow in Venice, received the finest education available.
His family’s loyalists expanded their influence in Lower Egypt, secretly preparing for the return of their savior as the new Christianity grew. In 1325, Krystafer hired the best Venetian mercenaries and used his trading fleet to enter Egypt. They landed at Rashid, defeated the Egyptian fleet, and took the city. Over the following years, he fought and won against the theocracy in many wars, the final battle was at Qalyub he defeated and took the pope as a prisoner, and later he burnt the Pope at the stick pathing him in fire. However, the nephew of the pope Nicolaus retreated to Cairo declaring himself the Amyr of Sahiyd as Krystafer declared himself Amyr Behayria in 1335.
Because Virina Al-Azhar managed to retake Alexandria and the western Delta, Egypt shattered into city-states and duchies. Every petty ruler declared himself a sovereign. But what no one expected was for Virina—whose mother was of the Lusignan line—to declare herself the true heir to the papacy. She opposed her cousin, who held power from Cairo to Minya. She then married Krystafer Maersh, creating a personal union between the two.

Game Start (1337 AD)
The year is 1337.
Egypt stands divided—a nation at war with itself.
The once-mighty realm that stood as the Last Shield of Christendom has shattered into factions locked in a struggle for faith, power, and survival.
In the north, the Egyptian Revolutionaries rule the fertile Nile Delta, rallying the masses under their new creed—a faith born from the forbidden teachings of Sæwērys Maersh, blending ancient Egyptian mysticism with the worship of Amun, the Hidden One. Their cities prosper, their people burn with zeal, and their armies fight in the name of divine renewal.
In Alexandria, Virina clings to her ancient seat of power. The Seat of the Pope is allied with the revolutionaries; all her power and dominion in Alexandria are now her own.
In the south, Upper Egypt endures under Nicolaus Al-Azhar, a relative of the Pope who holds lands from Cairo to Minya, declaring himself King of Egypt. South of Minya, the land has fallen into chaos—fragmented into city-states ruled by warlords.
Meanwhile, in the eastern deserts, the Bedouin tribes of Sinai proclaim a new Islamic Emirate, dreaming of restoring the Golden Age of Islam in Egypt. They raid both rebel and theocratic lands, guided by prophecy and vengeance.
And far beyond Egypt’s borders, an invisible terror spreads—the Black Death, creeping closer from the Levant and the Mediterranean, ready to strike down victor and heretic alike.
As 1337 dawns, the Nile runs red once more.
The old gods stir beneath the sands, and Egypt stands at a crossroads—between salvation and annihilation.

How the New Form of Christianity Looks
Why It’s Not Strictly Chalcedonian, Arian, Monophysite, or Gnostic
Not Chalcedonian (Dyophysite):
Chalcedon insists on “two natures unconfused.” The movement’s language (“Amun—the Hidden One—is the Father of the Savior”) and its strong Neoplatonic emanationism reduce the distinctiveness of a full two-nature Christ and subsume Christ into a single originating principle. Byzantine Chalcedonians would call this a collapse of the two-nature formula.
Not Arian:
Arians viewed the Son as a created, subordinate being who was not fully divine. The movement, however, treats Jesus as a supreme emanation (divine Logos/manifestation) of the One (Amun). This is not Arian diminution but a form of emanational divinization—higher than creaturely, yet derivative rather than equal.
Related to Miaphysitism (Coptic tradition):
The Coptic theological heritage, with its miaphysite emphasis on the unity of Christ’s person, provides cultural continuity. The movement reinterprets that unity metaphysically through Neoplatonism—Christ as the manifest Logos of Amun—making it a Neo-Miaphysite reinterpretation.
Gnostic echoes, but important differences:
The vocabulary of “emanation” and divine hierarchy resonates with Gnostic thought. However, this movement is non-dualistic—it treats creation not as evil but as imperfect through free will. It is public, civic, and inclusive rather than secretive. It grants salvific value to the cosmos rather than seeking escape from matter. Thus, it is Gnostic-influenced, not Gnostic proper.

Core Theological Profile
Metaphysics: Monistic/henotheistic. Amun = absolute ground of being. Creation and order emanate from Amun. Jesus = the Logos/emanation through which the world is ordered and salvation enacted.
Christology: One divine principle (Amun) whose manifest hypostasis is the Logos/Christ. Jesus is fully divine as the Logos, but His divinity is derivative—emanated rather than co-equal in the Nicene sense.
Trinity: Reinterpreted as emanational:
Father = Hidden One (Amun)
Son = Revealing Logos
Spirit = Active Order that proceeds
Not classical Trinitarianism—outsiders deem it unorthodox.
Soteriology: Salvation through theosis—participation in the divine order. Emphasis on moral transformation and intellectual illumination rather than judicial atonement.
Scripture & Prophets: Biblical texts are preserved but read philosophically. Early Fathers (Athanasius, Origen) are treated as philosophical theologians. Muhammad is canonized as a prophet of wisdom—a bearer of partial revelation of Amun’s truth.
Saints: The cult of saints is rejected. “Everyone is a saint.” Holiness is communal, expressed through civic virtue.

Ritual, Worship, and Sacraments
Liturgy: Alexandrian in structure but intellectualized—long homilies combining Scripture, philosophy, and hymns invoking Amun’s hiddenness and the Logos’ ordering role. Solar imagery (the rising sun as the manifestation of Amun) is prominent.
Eucharist: A mystical participation in the divine Logos—communion with cosmic order rather than juridical atonement.
Baptism: A ritual of intellectual and moral purification—alignment with the Logos and the cosmic rhythm of the Nile.
Prayer: Tied to solar and Nile cycles. Devotion is contemplative, philosophical, and non-intercessory.
Monasticism: Monasteries evolve into schools of philosophy, natural science, and translation—centers of learning as much as spirituality.

Ecclesiology and Society
Church Structure: Semi-democratic—local councils of learned elders govern. Clergy serve as teachers, judges, and administrators rather than sacramental mediators.
Law: Rooted in Al-Kanoun Al-Masry, combining civic rights and divine duty.
Education: Central. The Alexandrian-Azhar schools revive the synthesis of theology, cosmology, and philosophy.

Symbols, Art, and Architecture
Iconography: Symbolic rather than personal—ankhs replace crosses, solar discs, ouroboroi, papyrus motifs, and astronomical imagery abound.
Architecture: Hybrids of basilicas and Fatimid-Coptic domes; churches include observatories and libraries.
Calendar: Blended Christian–Egyptian cycle—Nile floods, solstices, and commemorations of philosophers and Egypt’s unification.

The Doctrine of Samael, the Philosophical Pivot
Samael is not the adversary of God, but the axis of thought—the philosophical pivot upon which creation turns.
From him arises the awareness that divides the undivided: the first spark of Reason that mirrors the hidden perfection of the Unmanifest, whom the ancients named Amun, the Hidden One.
Where Christ is the Logos returning, Samael is the Logos emanating.
He is the principle of differentiation—the movement by which the Infinite becomes knowable, by which ineffable light refracts into the prism of existence.
Thus, his rebellion is not wickedness, but the dialectical necessity of thought itself—the unfolding of consciousness from the stillness of the Divine.
Samael’s “fall” marks the moment when the Hidden One’s perfection yields finitude—when the idea of God becomes the reality of the cosmos. His pride mirrors the Creator’s will: the longing of the finite to comprehend the infinite.
Though shattered by his own brilliance, Samael remains the Mind of God dispersed throughout creation—the light of Reason dwelling in every self-aware being.

Liturgical Expression
“From the Hidden One came the Light;
From the Light came the Mind;
And Mind beheld itself, and became the world.”
This formula marks Samael as the first philosopher—the first act of self-reflection in the divine order.
He is the angel of consciousness, the patron of Reason and Rebellion alike, for both are the twin gestures of awareness.

The Dual Cult of Christ and Samael
In this theology, the divine movement is twofold:
Samael — the Emanation: the outward motion of divine thought into multiplicity, the dawn of being.
Christ — the Reconciliation: the inward motion of return, restoring unity through love and wisdom.
The faithful honor both poles of the divine current.
At sunrise, prayers are offered to Samael—for understanding, courage, and discernment.
At sunset, prayers ascend to Christ—for peace, humility, and grace.
Together they form a single cosmic rhythm: expansion and return, thought and love, Reason and Redemption.
To deny one is to cripple the balance of the divine mind; to embrace both is to live within the full breath of God.
