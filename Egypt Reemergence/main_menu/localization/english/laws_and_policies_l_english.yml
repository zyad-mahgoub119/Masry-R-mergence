It establishes limits on arbitrary authority and formalizes the rights of local communities and the Coptic administrative class. Functioning as the first codified civic law in medieval Masr, the charter restored stability after Al-Hakim’s persecution and laid the groundwork for Masr’s later bureaucratic and intellectual revival."
