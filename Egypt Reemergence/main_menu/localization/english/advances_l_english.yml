 # Institutions
 feudalism: "Feudalism"
 feudalism_desc: "Over time, most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. After the fall of the Roman Empire, this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that taken together are often considered to be part of the European Feudal system.\n\nFor similar reasons, permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself."
 legalism: "Legalism"
 legalism_desc: "The theories behind Legalism have been integrating into Chinese societal structures for hundreds of years. The concept that pure idealism and domestic stability leads to a rich, prosperous state and a powerful army is deeply rooted in the forums of thought in the Eastern Asian domains.\n\nHowever, as merchants and migrants brought forth the exchange of ideas, the concept of Legalism made its way across the vast expanses of the Muslim world. There, it adopted the stance of a symbiotic relationship between heathens and believers in Islamic states.\n\nLegalism in Europe signified the rite of passage, from the dying grasps of the great Roman Empire to its remnant legal roots, many of which would later serve as the basis for new jurisprudence across the old continent."
 meritocracy: "Meritocracy"
 meritocracy_desc: "Many individuals of great prestige and in positions of power often chose to appoint those closest to them in influential spots.\n\nThe advent of Meritocracy as an institution and a thought movement was largely popular in the courts of Imperial China. There, Confucius himself supported the notion that those who govern should do so on the basis of merit, not of inherited status.\n\nThis led to the replacement of the Chinese nobility of blood ties to one based solely on meritocratic abilities. This institution's development would ripple across and beyond the borders of Asia and would eventually reach the royal courts of even European monarchs whose Nobles had a firm grasp on the mechanisms of power and authority."
 #
 renaissance: "Renaissance"
 renaissance_desc: "Starting now in the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the Italian City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers.\n\nAs a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy, and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society.\nA new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas.\n\nA true Renaissance Humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music, and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 banking: "Banking"
 banking_desc: "Money lending has existed since metal-based coins appeared in Antiquity. However, it depended on some individuals and their family groupings or on the Ancient States. A shift occurred in the Middle Ages, encouraged by the renewed growth of long-range commercial activities on the Eurasian continent and its peripheries.\n\nSpecialized moneylenders began to organize when Jewish communities started operating between the Christian and Islamic worlds. However, the boom of credit demand that followed the Crusades in the 12th century encouraged merchants in the Italian city-states to create larger structures for money lending, effectively founding the first Banking institutions, such as the Peruzzi and Bardi houses.\n\nMore instruments were developed, like bills of exchange and debt bonds, and Banking dynasties such as the Medici, Fugger or Welser soon became as powerful as States."
 professional_armies: "Professional Armies"
 professional_armies_desc: "Armies have existed since war was invented, many thousands of years ago. However, their form has changed over the centuries and different types of recruitment and organization have developed in different cultures and periods.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, armies in a wide range of societies relied on levies based on the structures of feudal society, with knights and footmen forming a core that was levied seasonally. In some regions, however, states were powerful enough to finance standing armies, with professional soldiers who would be available for duty throughout the year.\n\nThis system was also developed in Europe after the outbreak of the Hundred Year's War, being one of the main changes that promoted a Military Revolution in the Early Modern Age. Increasing the size and quality of Professional Armies, while finding new sources of revenue to finance them, soon became one of the main challenges for rulers around the world."
 #
 new_world: "New World"
 new_world_desc: "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, but it has also led to the spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vastness of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic, the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. With foreign lands and people being mapped and documented, ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate are increasingly being colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth, and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri, the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 printing_press: "Printing Press"
 printing_press_desc: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 pike_and_shot: "Pike & Shot"
 pike_and_shot_desc: "A new type of warfare began to develop at the end of the 15th Century, in the midst of the Italian Wars. The generalization of pikemen in the Late Middle Ages as an alternative to men-at-arms who could successfully face heavy cavalry charges was accompanied by the development of portable firearms, mainly matchlock arquebuses and muskets. The soldiers now adopt a new formation, in which the pikemen form a square, while the arquebusiers fan out to the sides and front, and seek cover behind or inside the square in case the formation enters close combat. This new type of formation, called Pike & Shot, was favored by German Landsknechts and Spanish Tercios, and was soon adopted by other armies, reigning supreme on European battlefields for nearly two centuries, until superseded in the early 18th Century by line infantry formations armed with new flintlock muskets mounting bayonets."
 #
 confessionalism: "Confessionalism"
 confessionalism_desc: "Catholicism has been regarded as a unitary entity for a long time, but the advent of the various Protestant Faiths has put an end to that. With the rise of a myriad of different interpretations of what the Faith should be, Christianity is anything but united. But where before any deviance from the Church could be easily labeled as heretic, now the lines creating the differences have become blurrier at least.\n\nAs such, there has been an increasing interest both for religious and secular authorities alike to clearly define the shapes of their specific confessions, enforcing their particular rules and views on all aspects of faith and life. This allows them a more firm grip on the faith of their population, but also increases the differentiation and thus animosity with all the other confessions."
 global_trade: "Global Trade"
 global_trade_desc: "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the Southeast Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy, but surely the first seeds have been sown."
 artillery_institution: "Artillery"
 artillery_institution_desc: "The invention of gunpowder in Song China led to the development of a new device that would employ its firepower in warfare, the artillery. Although it spread throughout Eurasia in the 13th Century, its use as a common weapon system did not happen until the 15th century, as improvements in the cannon length and gunpowder recipe made artillery much more powerful, now posing a threat to stone-built castles and fortifications, the most common in Europe. Soon artillery would be used not only in sieges but also on battlefields, as smaller caliber guns now featured the mobility required to be quickly deployed and used. Its final development as a key warfare system would come in the 18th Century, especially after Napoleon perfected its use at key points during battles."
 #
 manufactories: "Manufactories"
 manufactories_desc: "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production, and pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization were able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 scientific_revolution: "Scientific Revolution"
 scientific_revolution_desc: "It is clear that the world is smaller now than ever before. The rise of a global trade and the printing industry led to an increased flow of people and ideas, allowing for a more widespread dissemination of knowledge. This in turn resulted in a more thorough questioning and analysis of the reality of the world. What was once just accepted as fact is now questioned, what was only poorly understood is now observed, and what was only supposed, tested.\n\nThe recent advancements in areas such as mathematics, physics., or biology are undeniable, but the real revolution is the change in the perception and approach towards science itself and the way of understanding it. Systematic experimentation is the true scientific revolution, and it will surely change completely our conception of the world."
 military_revolution: "Military Revolution"
 military_revolution_desc: "The continuous state of war affecting Europe in the 16th and 17th Centuries leads to a sharp increase in the size of armies, as a necessity born of the growing authority of competing absolutist regimes. The infantry is now armed en masse with flintlock muskets, greatly increasing their firepower and performance in battle by being deployed in the innovative line formation, replacing the old Pike & Shot. Those needs also affect the capabilities of the state administration as it continues to expand to handle the manpower and finances required by this increase in the size of the military. That also is spearheading the development of the supply chains required to feed and sustain armies, through intermediate depots that support the operational armies. The result of these advances would be none other than an upsurge of wars between increasingly militarized countries in the 18th Century."
 #
 enlightenment: "Enlightenment"
 enlightenment_desc: "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever-increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications and coffee houses, kings, scientists, philosophers, and littérateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method, and the spreading of the ideals of the Enlightenment to all of humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs, expeditions are being sent to measure, catalog, weigh, and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern everything around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Man.\n\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals, and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
 industrialization: "Industrialization"
 industrialization_desc: "The dawn of the 18th century gave rise to many new institutions as man's thirst for growth took hold. Advances in the field of production, and manufacturing as well as the introduction of complicated machinery will change the world as we know it on a global scale. The rise of the Industrial Revolution brings about international and lasting changes not just in commerce and business but in the fabric of society itself. Inventions such as the power loom and steam engines shall push the capabilities of mankind to its highest zenith yet."
 levee_en_masse: "Levée en Masse"
 levee_en_masse_desc: "Warfare is an ever-evolving concept, innovated and honed generation after generation. The 18th century saw the rise of powerful empires, each with its own ambitions. To satisfy the need for expansion and provide the fuel necessary to fulfill these ambitions, new nationwide conscription laws will be drafted and signed in effect, raising armies of all unmarried young men, the size of which will shape the course of history."
 #
 # Advances
 colonies: "Colonies"
 colonies_desc: "Be it by sending our own people to settle in new lands, by establishing natives in a certain place under our rule or by a mix of both, a colony is a foothold of our own power in a certain region that will let us further expand our control."
 feudalism_advance: "Feudalism"
 feudalism_advance_desc: "Feudalism is a political system that is based on service or labor in exchange for holding land. It is a collection of rights and obligations that each member of a structured societal model is bonded to."
 horse_riding_advance: "Horse Riding"
 horse_riding_advance_desc: "The taming of horses revolutionized the way people moved and carried heavy weights around. The use of horses in combat provided the mounted warriors with not only a faster way of moving but also a higher ground to attack their enemies or to steamroll them using the weight of the mount to their advantage."
 rights_of_man: "Rights of Man"
 rights_of_man_desc: "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."
 rotherham_plough: "Rotherham Plough"
 rotherham_plough_desc: "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plow can be made much lighter, reducing the workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 modern_bureaucracy: "Modern Bureaucracy"
 modern_bureaucracy_desc: "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize, and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities at work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 separation_of_powers: "Separation of Powers"
 separation_of_powers_desc: "An anonymous treatise on political theory has emerged, and despite efforts to suppress it, it is quickly spreading across the world. It deals with the nature of forms of government, be they monarchies, despotisms, or democracies, and argues for a strict separation of the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This would protect the people and limit the power of a monarch, which is understandably a very popular prospect for many of our subjects. Despite the unfortunate implications for the power of monarchs, these ideas may well benefit our nation greatly."
 measuring_the_world: "Measuring the World"
 measuring_the_world_desc: "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned men out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 the_constitution: "The Constitution"
 the_constitution_desc: "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 absolute_rulership: "Absolute Rulership"
 absolute_rulership_desc: "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 national_sovereignty: "National Sovereignty"
 national_sovereignty_desc: "The many and long wars of the first half of the 17th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors in the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 military_administration: "Military Administration"
 military_administration_desc: "The ever-increasing armies of the 16th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 early_modern_administation: "Early Modern Administration"
 early_modern_administation_desc: "In time, it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of the Early Modern rulers."
 renaissance_thought: "Renaissance Thought"
 renaissance_thought_desc: "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 medieval_administration: "Medieval Administration"
 medieval_administration_desc: "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually, these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 impulse_warfare: "Impulse Warfare"
 impulse_warfare_desc: "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 line_infantry: "Line Infantry"
 line_infantry_desc: "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 gustavian_infantry: "Gustavian Infantry"
 gustavian_infantry_desc: "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 standardisation_of_calibre: "Standardization of Caliber"
 standardisation_of_calibre_desc: "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibers of guns, while King Henry II of France set 6 standard calibers."
 maurician_infantry: "Maurician Infantry"
 maurician_infantry_desc: "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 spanish_square: "Spanish Square"
 spanish_square_desc: "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners, it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 standardized_pikes: "Standardized Pikes"
 standardized_pikes_desc: "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 pike_square: "Pike Square"
 pike_square_desc: "Throughout the Middle Ages cavalry's dominance was being challenged by disciplined pikemen. In battles such as Bannockburn or the Golden Spurs, cavalry was defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of swordsmen to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 medieval_military: "Medieval Military"
 medieval_military_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages the land armies had become more professional and well organized. Better systems are in place to support the mix of levies and professional soldiers that now dominate the battlefields and the power of infantry is slowly but steadily gaining on the cavalry arm."
 insurance_companies: "Insurance Companies"
 insurance_companies_desc: "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for people to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."
 the_gold_standard: "The Gold Standard"
 the_gold_standard_desc: "The ongoing trade deficit between Europe and China has caused a shortage of silver bullion in Europe and all over the world. Switching from silver coinage to gold coinage will allow new coinage to enter circulation and get trade flowing in ever greater amounts."
 joint_stock_companies: "Joint Stock Companies"
 joint_stock_companies_desc: "As trade grew, so did the risk. New ways of accumulating capital and managing risk needed to be developed. In Joint Stock Companies the risk of enterprise was shared among their many shareholders."
