 flavor_BEH.1.title: "The Turks have taken Constantinople"
 flavor_BEH.1.desc: "The news of Constantinople's fall; the final demise of the Eastern Roman Empire—elicited a reaction that was a complex blend of sullen detachment and profound unease. The revolutionary government in the Nile Delta, having already broken definitively with the Coptic theocracy and the Roman Papacy, held no sentimental loyalty to the Byzantine cause. The Byzantine Emperor was merely a distant cousin in faith. However, the fall of the City was not ignored; it was a troubling geopolitical tremor. For centuries, Constantinople had stood as a powerful, if flawed, 'Last Shield' against the vastness of the Islamic world, a title Egypt itself claimed after defeating the Mongols. Its destruction by the burgeoning Ottoman Sultanate removed the ultimate buffer state. Now faced an unparalleled Islamic military power expanding across the sea. The dilemma was clear: while they didn't mourn the Romans, they were now dangerously exposed to an enemy whose ambitions stretched directly across the Levant and toward the rich granaries of the Nile."

[target_character.GetHisHer|U] most significant work, #italic Aigybdyaka II#!, is a comprehensive history of [ShowRegionNameWithNoTooltip('egypt_region')] spanning over more than 10000 pages, capturing both the grandeur and the struggles of our land. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] would be graced with the presence of such a significant personality."
 flavor_BEH.59.a: "Appoint [target_character.GetHimHer] as our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] historian."
 flavor_BEH.59.b: "[target_character.GetHisHer|U] writings are of no use to us."

 flavor_BEH.60.desc: "With [ShowLocationName('alexandria')], [ShowLocationName('cairo')], and [ShowLocationName('jerusalem')] under our direct rule, we now stand as the true shield of [ShowReligionGroupName('christian')] and guardians of its most sacred sites. This holy responsibility brings us prestige but also demands vigilance and dedication. As [target_ruler.GetName] proudly styles [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] as the Custodian of the Holy Cities, pilgrims from all corners of the [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('christian')|U] world will look to us for protection on their sacred journeys, and we are now seen as defenders of the faith itself. May we prove worthy of this solemn duty."
 flavor_BEH.60.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] favors his faithful!"

 flavor_BEH.70.title: "The [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip] of [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('cairo')]"
 flavor_BEH.70.desc: "Much older than our own [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], [target_location.GetName] has been embellished by rulers and conquerors for hundreds if not thousands of years. Bringing order to this maze of buildings, from the tombs of the [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of the dead and the slums of Fustat and Memfy, to the bustling markets of Turbat az-Za'faran, or the great Citadel of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] itself, has long been a monumental task for many of our predecessors. Nonetheless, as the master of the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip], [target_character.GetName], is expected to leave [target_character.GetHerHis] mark upon the place, both to embellish and develop it, and to combat disease and keep the order."
 flavor_BEH.70.a: "Let us renovate the Agoras and the Turbat az-Za'faran."
 flavor_BEH.70.b: "We must renovate the growing slums and the suburbs."
 flavor_BEH.70.c: "The Mosques-Cathedrals and the Azhar require our attention."
 flavor_BEH.70.d: "Coming generations shall envy the monuments we erect."
 flavor_BEH.70.e: "There is not much we can do for the citizens right now."

 flavor_BEH.74.title: "Færousiya"
 flavor_BEH.74.desc: "The Færousiya are a set of equestrian exercises that teach young warriors the craft of cavalry warfare. With codified rules, manuals, and popular competitions, the Færousiya has in many ways been perfected by Masry warrior aristocracy. While some chroniclers would claim that the champions of today could never compete with the warriors of the past, it is still both customary, and very popular, for any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to arrange big public Færousiya competitions, and the champions remain the heroes of many popular tales. All of this has inspired [target_character.GetName], an expert when it comes to warfare, and now wishes to organize even more tournaments among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors."
 flavor_BEH.74.a: "This is good for the people, but not something that [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] should spend money on."
 flavor_BEH.74.b: "Let us expand and build new hippodromes to patronize the flowers of chivalry."
 
 flavor_BEH.77.title: "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 flavor_BEH.77.desc: "The rich floodplains of [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')], especially in the Nile Delta, remain the breadbasket of the eastern Mediterranean. Our [ShowGoodsName('wheat')] feeds cities from [ShowLocationName('constantinople')] to [ShowLocationName('damascus')] and secures our place as a vital economic and logistical power. Some in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] suggest investing further into agricultural reforms and expanding grain production to ensure food stability and profit."
 flavor_BEH.77.a: "Invest to boost the production."
 flavor_BEH.77.b: "The current production is sufficient."

 flavor_BEH.78.title: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_BEH.78.desc: "[target_character.GetName] has begun publishing a series of works on theology, social customs, and history. Through the combination rigorous biblical scholarship and records of daily life, [target_character.GetHerHis] anthropological work, which focuses primarily on marriage and divorce, has resulted in interesting findings. The research revealed that at least one third of women in [ShowLocationName('cairo')] married at least twice, with many marrying thrice, and that about one third of all marriages ended in a divorce. Though many believe that supporting [target_character.GetHerHim] work could yield even more interesting results, others believe that funding a research which focuses on trivial things such as marriages would be a waste of our finances."
 flavor_BEH.78.a: "Support [target_character.GetHerHim] research and publishing."
 flavor_BEH.78.b: "We cannot afford to fund every research."

 flavor_BEH.100.title: "The Repercussions of [mansa_musa.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_BEH.100.desc: "The pilgrimage of [mansa_musa.GetName] in 1325 was a great sight to behold for our people. What nobody was expecting was the generosity of the Mansa who traveled through our land to reach [ShowLocationName('mecca')]. On his journey, the great [GetCountry('MAL').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] gave away [ShowGoodsName('goods_gold')], [ShowGoodsName('gems')], and other invaluable goods away to all kinds of people.\n\nWhile [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] may bless his soul, his actions have had unforeseen consequences for our economy. Our markets are flooded with [mansa_musa.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s gold, which caused its value to plummet. Nowadays, the effects are by far not as bad as many years ago, yet his impact is still noticeable."
 flavor_BEH.100.a: "Hopefully, the next Mansa is wiser with generosity."
